\subsection{Context and Motivation}
\begin{spacing}{1.2}
The emergence of advanced analytics in sports, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, has revolutionized how games are analyzed and understood. Specifically, ice hockey, with its fast-paced and intricate team dynamics, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for technological innovation. This project lies at the intersection of these technological advancements and the growing demand for in-depth sports analytics.

The primary motivation for this investigation stems from the inherent limitations of traditional player tracking methods in ice hockey, which are mainly manual, tedious, and not sufficiently robust to capture the complex, high-speed movements that are typical of the sport. These traditional methods often yield data that lacks the depth and precision necessary for a comprehensive analysis of player performance and team strategies.

% In response to these challenges, recent studies have explored the potential of machine learning and computer vision to provide more detailed and accurate tracking of player movements. For instance, the work by [Author et al., Year] demonstrated the application of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and Deep SORT tracking algorithm in real-time player tracking across various sports. However, the unique context of ice hockey, with its rapid changes in player positions and frequent occlusions, calls for a specialized approach that can reliably distinguish between players, referees, and the puck, while also adapting to the sport's fast-paced nature.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system tailored to the specific demands of ice hockey, including advanced object detection, player tracking, and team classification methodologies. Consequently, the goal is to address the essential requirement for accurate and automated tracking in professional ice hockey games, offering teams and coaches valuable insights to guide strategic choices and improve overall team performance.

Furthermore, the project recognizes the growing interest in sports analytics for performance optimization and enhancing fan engagement and viewership experiences. By facilitating a more detailed analysis of game dynamics, player tracking systems contribute to more engaging and immersive viewing experiences, potentially transforming how fans engage with the sport.

In summary, this project is motivated by the intersection of technical challenges, the potential for significant contributions to sports analytics in ice hockey, and the broader implications for team performance and fan engagement. Through the investigation grounded in the latest research and technological innovations, it aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in sports analytics and player tracking.

\setlength{\parskip}{0.3cm}
\subsection{Machine Learning in Sports Analytics}
\begin{spacing}{1.2}
The integration of machine learning (ML) into sports analytics marks a paradigm shift from conventional statistical methods to more sophisticated, predictive models that can analyze complex patterns and interactions within sports data. This transition is driven by the demand for more accurate analytics to enhance team performance, strategy formulation, and player evaluation. Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Rather than being explicitly programmed to perform a task, these systems are trained on a dataset, allowing them to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. In the context of sports analytics, ML techniques are used to process and analyze vast amounts of game data to uncover patterns, make predictions, and provide insights that can enhance decision-making for teams and coaches.

The effectiveness of machine learning in sports analytics is predicated on its ability to handle the high dimensionality of sports data and to learn from data to make accurate predictions or classifications. Unlike traditional statistical methods that often require simplifications or assumptions about the data, ML algorithms can model complex relationships within the data, offering a more nuanced understanding of game dynamics. This capability is valuable in sports like ice hockey, where the fast pace and intricate team dynamics present unique analytical challenges.

The integration of machine learning into sports analytics represents a significant advancement in how sports data is analyzed and utilized. By leveraging complex algorithms to interpret and predict sports outcomes, ML opens new avenues for performance optimization, strategic planning, and enhancing the competitive edge of teams and athletes. This overview sets the stage for exploring specific ML techniques and their application in tracking players in professional ice hockey matches, which is the focus of this project.

\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Player Detection}
One of the key ML techniques employed in player detection within sports videos is the convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective at analyzing visual imagery. They use a series of convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. This capability makes them exceptionally suited for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and even video analysis.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) stand out in the machine learning landscape for their exceptional ability to process and analyze images, making them ideal for applications such as player detection in sports videos. The architecture of a CNN is designed to mimic the way the human visual cortex works, allowing it to efficiently recognize patterns, shapes, and objects within complex visual inputs.

A CNN is composed of several layers that process and transform the input image to extract relevant features for the task at hand, such as detecting players on a sports field. A CNN architecture is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cnn}. These layers include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Layers}: The backbone of a CNN, these layers apply filters (or kernels) to the input image to create feature maps. Each filter is designed to detect specific features, such as edges, textures, or parts of objects (e.g., a player's jersey or helmet). By sliding the filter across the image, the network can capture spatial hierarchies of features, from simple to complex.

    \item \textbf{Activation Layers}: Following convolution, an activation function such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the network. This step is crucial for enabling the CNN to learn and model complex patterns in the data.

    \item \textbf{Pooling Layers}: These layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps, making the detection process computationally efficient while retaining essential information. Max pooling, for example, reduces the size of the feature maps by taking the maximum value in a specific window, enhancing the network's ability to focus on the most prominent features.

    \item \textbf{Fully Connected Layers}: Towards the end of the CNN architecture, fully connected layers combine all the features learned by previous layers to classify the image or detect objects within it. In the context of player detection, this involves determining whether a region of the image contains a player and identifying the player's location.

    \item \textbf{Output Layer}: The final layer outputs the detection results, typically in the form of bounding boxes around detected players and classification scores indicating the confidence level of the detections.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:cnn}
\end{figure}

Training a CNN involves showing it thousands of labeled images, where the locations of players are marked with bounding boxes. The network adjusts its weights through a process known as backpropagation, where the difference between the predicted output and the actual label is used to update the weights in a way that minimizes this difference. This learning process enables the CNN to improve its ability to detect players as it goes through more training images.

The YOLO algorithm represents a significant advancement in utilizing CNNs for object detection, including player detection. Unlike traditional approaches that scan an image in parts to find objects, YOLO looks at the entire image in a single pass, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the full images. This holistic approach allows YOLO to detect objects, such as players, rapidly and accurately, making it highly effective for real-time sports analytics applications.

By leveraging CNNs and advanced algorithms like YOLO, player detection systems can achieve remarkable accuracy, enabling detailed analysis of game dynamics and player movements without manual labeling or tracking. This automated, efficient processing of visual data opens up new possibilities for enhancing sports strategies, player evaluations, and audience engagement through enriched visual content.

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Player Classification}

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) serve as a robust tool for classification tasks within the domain of machine learning, excelling for tasks such as differentiating between player types or identifying referees among players in the context of sports analytics. SVM is a supervised learning model renowned for its application in both classification and regression challenges.

The fundamental operation of an SVM Figure~\ref{fig:SVM} involves constructing a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space. The goal is to find the hyperplane that best divides the dataset into classes, which is particularly advantageous for binary classification tasks. The decision to designate a hyperplane as "the best" hinges on its ability to offer the largest margin between the two classes it separates. This margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from either class, known as a support vector.

The steps to achieve this are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transformation into High-Dimensional Space}: In scenarios where the data is not linearly separable in its original space, SVM employs a technique called the kernel trick. This approach transforms the input data space into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation is feasible without explicitly computing the coordinates in this new space, thus preserving computational efficiency.

    \item \textbf{Optimization of the Hyperplane}: The SVM algorithm seeks to maximize the margin between the classes by adjusting the orientation and position of the hyperplane. This process involves solving an optimization problem that determines the hyperplane parameters minimizing classification errors while maximizing the margin.

    \item \textbf{Support Vectors Identification}: The data points that are closest to the hyperplane and directly influence its position and orientation are identified as support vectors. These points are critical since their removal or alteration would change the hyperplane's construction.

    \item \textbf{Classification Decision}: Once the optimal hyperplane is established, SVM can classify new data points based on which side of the hyperplane they fall on. For binary classification, this involves assigning a class label based on the sign of the decision function, which is a measure of the distance of a data point from the hyperplane.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/SVM.png}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{Support Vector Machine}
\label{fig:SVM}
\end{figure}

In the realm of sports analytics, particularly in the context of tracking players in videos, SVMs play a crucial role in classifying detected objects post their detection. Features such as HSV histograms, extracted from the bounding boxes around detected players serve as inputs to the SVM. Based on these features, the SVM classifies each object as either a player, a referee, or an irrelevant object. This classification step is instrumental in refining the detection accuracy by filtering out objects that do not pertain to the game's context.

In essence, SVMs complement the object detection capabilities of CNNs by providing a reliable method for the subsequent classification of detected objects. This synergy between CNNs and SVMs empowers the development of sophisticated player tracking systems, driving forward the analytics in sports through detailed game dynamics and player performance insights.

\subsection{Player Detection}
\begin{spacing}{1.2}

In the evolving landscape of sports analytics, especially in player detection within sports videos, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm has emerged as a game-changer. YOLO is an object detection system that differs fundamentally from the detection systems that came before it. Unlike systems that apply the detection model to various regions of the image, YOLO frames object detection as a single regression problem, directly from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. This approach allows YOLO to achieve remarkable speed and accuracy, making it ideal for player detection in sports analytics.

\subsubsection{Understanding YOLO's Mechanism}
YOLO divides the input image into a grid (e.g., 13x13). For each grid cell, it predicts multiple bounding boxes and confidence scores for those boxes. The confidence score reflects the accuracy of the bounding box and the probability that the box contains a specific object. Alongside, YOLO predicts class probabilities for each bounding box. The combination of the bounding box confidence score and the class prediction determines the final probability that a box contains a specific type of object, such as a player.

\subsubsection{Grid Division and Bounding Box Prediction}

The YOLO framework begins by dividing the input image into an $S \times S$ grid. Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes and their associated properties as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GridPred}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The center of the bounding box $(b_x, b_y)$, relative to the bounds of the grid cell.
    \item The width $(b_w)$ and height $(b_h)$ of the bounding box, relative to the entire image.
    \item A confidence score that signifies the box's accuracy and the likelihood that it contains an object.
\end{itemize}

The formulas for the bounding box predictions are as follows:
\begin{align*}
    b_x &= \sigma(t_x) + c_x \\
    b_y &= \sigma(t_y) + c_y \\
    b_w &= p_w e^{t_w} \\
    b_h &= p_h e^{t_h} \\
    \text{Confidence} &= \sigma(t_o)
\end{align*}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sigma$ represents the sigmoid function, ensuring outputs between 0 and 1.
    \item $t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h$ are the model's predictions
    \item $c_x, c_y$ represent the top-left corner of the grid cell
    \item $p_w$ and $p_h$ are predefined dimensions of the bounding boxes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/GridPred.png}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{Grid Division and Bounding Box Prediction}
\label{fig:GridPred}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Class Probability Prediction}

For each grid cell, YOLO predicts conditional class probabilities $Pr(Class_i | Object)$ for $C$ classes, using the formula:
\begin{equation*}
    Pr(Class_i | Object) = \sigma(t_{i})
\end{equation*}
where $t_{i}$ is the predicted probability for class $i$.

This prediction is independent of the bounding boxes, assuming every box has the same class distribution.


\subsubsection{Non-max Suppression}
After predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities, non-max suppression (NMS) is applied to reduce overlapping boxes, keeping only the box with the highest confidence score while removing others that predict the same object. This step is crucial for reducing the number of false positives as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NMS}. NMS steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sort all bounding boxes by their confidence scores in descending order.
    \item Keep the highest confidence box and remove others with an IOU greater than a certain threshold.
    \item Repeat step 2 for the remaining boxes.
\end{enumerate}

The Intersection Over Union (IOU) metric plays a central role in this process by quantifying the overlap between bounding boxes, enabling the algorithm to determine which boxes to keep and which to discard. IOU is a measure used to evaluate the similarity between two bounding boxes. It is defined as the ratio of the area of overlap between the two bounding boxes to the area of their union. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
\begin{equation*}
    IOU = \frac{Area\: of\: Overlap}{Area\: of\: Union}
\end{equation*}

The value of IOU ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 represents perfect overlap. In the context of non-max suppression, IOU is used to compare each pair of bounding boxes that detect the same object.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/NMS.png}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{Non-max Suppression}
\label{fig:NMS}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Combining Predictions}
Finally, YOLO combines the bounding box predictions with the class probability predictions:
\begin{equation*}
    Score_{class_i} = Pr(Object) \times IOU_{pred}^{truth} \times Pr(Class_i | Object)
\end{equation*}

This approach enables YOLO to efficiently detect objects, including player detection in sports analytics.

\subsection{Color-based Team Classification using HSV Histograms and K-means Clustering}
\begin{spacing}{1.2}

The identification of players in sports analytics, particularly in dynamic and fast-paced environments like ice hockey, is crucial for player tracking, performance analysis, and tactical assessment. Distinguishing between two teams and referees through their jerseys is a common approach. This section explores the technical details leveraging the HSV color space and K-means clustering to achieve robust team classification against the challenges posed by variable lighting and diverse camera angles.

\subsubsection{HSV Histograms for Color Feature Extraction}

HSV color space offers a more intuitive arrangement of colors as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HSV}, making it easier to handle variations in lighting when processing video frames. HSV separates the color (hue) from the brightness (value), which is particularly useful in sports analytics where lighting can significantly vary. It consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hue (H):} The color type, represented as an angle from 0 to 360 degrees. Normalized to 0 to 1 (or 0 to 255).
    \item \textbf{Saturation (S):} The intensity of the color, from pure (100\%) to grayscale (0\%).
    \item \textbf{Value (V):} The brightness of the color, where 0 is black, and 100\% shows the most color.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/HSV.jpeg}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{HSV colour space}
\label{fig:HSV}
\end{figure}

A histogram for each HSV channel is computed for the player's jersey within a bounding box. The histograms are normalized to ensure consistency across different sizes of Region of Interest (ROI). The histograms are normalized as:
\[ H(i) = \frac{n_i}{N} \]
where \(n_i\) is the number of pixels in the $i^{th}$ bin, and \(N\) is the total number of pixels. 

This normalization process results in a feature vector for each channel, which, when concatenated, forms a comprehensive color feature vector for the ROI.

\subsubsection{Gaussian Blur}

Gaussian blur is utilized to preprocess the jersey's Region of Interest (ROI) by reducing noise, enabling a more accurate color histogram computation as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GausianBlur}. The Gaussian function applied to each pixel \textit{x} in the image is given by:
\[ G(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]
where \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. 

This function smoothens color transitions and minimizes outliers as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:GausianBlur}, which might skew the histogram representation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/GausianBlur.png}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{Gausian Blur Effect}
\label{fig:GausianBlur}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Jersey ROI}
% A central portion, typically 50\% of the bounding box, is considered to ensure the histogram captures the dominant jersey color.

The Region of Interest (ROI) for each player's jersey is defined by zooming into the central part of the bounding box detected around a player as represented in Figure~\ref{fig:JerseyROI}. This is based on the most distinct and consistent color of a player’s team is on the jersey. To ensure the histogram focuses on this part, a fixed percentage (e.g., 50\%) reduction from the original bounding box dimensions centers the ROI on the jersey.

\subsubsection{Feature Vectors from HSV Histograms}

The feature vector for the jersey's color distribution is constructed by concatenating the normalized histograms of the H, S, and V channels. Given bins \textit{b} for each histogram, the feature vector \textit{F} can be represented as:
\[ F = [H_1, H_2, ..., H_b, S_1, S_2, ..., S_b, V_1, V_2, ..., V_b] \]
This vector is crucial, serving as the input for the subsequent K-means clustering for team classification.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{images/JerseyROI.jpeg}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{Jersey Region of Interest}
\label{fig:JerseyROI}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{K-means Clustering for Team Classification}

K-means clustering aims to partition \textit{n} observations into \textit{k} clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean as represented in Figure~\ref{fig:KmeansCluster}. K-means clustering partitions players into teams based on the similarity of their jersey colors. The
clustering process works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialization - select \(k\) cluster centroids randomly from the dataset, denoted as \(\mu_1, \mu_2, ..., \mu_k\) where \(k\) is the predefined number of clusters.
    \item Assignment Step - assign each data point \(x_i\) to the nearest cluster by calculating the Euclidean distance to each centroid and selecting the smallest. The assignment \(C(i)\) for each point \(x_i\) is given by:
    \[ C(i) = \arg\min_{k} \|\|x_i - \mu_k\|\|_2^2 \]
    \item Update Step - after all points have been assigned to clusters, update the centroids of the clusters to be the mean of the points assigned to each cluster. The updated position of centroid \(k\) is calculated as:
    \[ \mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{i \in C_k} x_i \]
    where \(C_k\) is the set of points assigned to cluster \(k\).
    \item Iteration - repeat the assignment and update steps iteratively until the centroids no longer change significantly, or a predefined number of iterations is reached. This implies convergence to a solution.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/KmeansCluster.png}
\captionsetup{font=large}
\caption{K-means Clustering}
\label{fig:KmeansCluster}
\end{figure}


The objective is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS):
\[ \text{Minimize} \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2 \]
where \(C_i\) is the $i^{th}$ cluster, \(x\) is a feature vector, and \(\mu_i\) is the centroid of \(C_i\). 

% Through iterative updates, the algorithm converges, classifying players into two distinct clusters representing the teams.

The algorithm iterates between assigning observations to the nearest cluster centroid and updating the centroids based on the current cluster memberships until convergence.

In the context of team classification, this method effectively groups players into clusters (teams) based on their jersey colors represented by the feature vectors. This automatic categorization facilitates further analysis such as tracking, performance metrics, and tactical assessments in sports video analytics.
