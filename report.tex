In the context of ice hockey, a sport known for its speed and complexity, the need for advanced player-tracking systems is particularly pronounced. This project introduces a comprehensive system designed to track ice hockey players in professional match videos with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency, leveraging the YOLO object detection framework and Deep SORT algorithm to accurately identify and follow players, and clustering techniques to distinguish teams and referees. It represents a significant leap in sports analytics, offering precise player detection and tracking, team classification, and a bird's-eye view transformation of the ice rink for advanced strategic analysis. Evaluated across key metrics, the system achieved an impressive player and referee detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96\% and facilitated groundbreaking insights into player positioning and team tactics through its bird's-eye view feature. This advancement underscores the transformative potential of integrating machine learning and computer vision in sports analytics, providing a powerful tool for performance analysis and showcasing a notable contribution to the strategic understanding of professional ice hockey.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context and Motivation}
\begin{spacing}{1.3}
The emergence of advanced analytics in sports, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, has revolutionized how games are analyzed and understood. Specifically, ice hockey, with its fast-paced and intricate team dynamics, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for technological innovation. This project lies at the intersection of these technological advancements and the growing demand for in-depth sports analytics.

The primary motivation for this investigation stems from the inherent limitations of traditional player tracking methods in ice hockey, which are mainly manual, tedious, and not sufficiently robust to capture the complex, high-speed movements that are typical of the sport. These traditional methods often yield data that lacks the depth and precision necessary for a comprehensive analysis of player performance and team strategies.

% In response to these challenges, recent studies have explored the potential of machine learning and computer vision to provide more detailed and accurate tracking of player movements. For instance, the work by [Author et al., Year] demonstrated the application of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and Deep SORT tracking algorithm in real-time player tracking across various sports. However, the unique context of ice hockey, with its rapid changes in player positions and frequent occlusions, calls for a specialized approach that can reliably distinguish between players, referees, and the puck, while also adapting to the sport's fast-paced nature.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system tailored to the specific demands of ice hockey, including advanced object detection, player tracking, and team classification methodologies. Consequently, the goal is to address the essential requirement for accurate and automated tracking in professional ice hockey games, offering teams and coaches valuable insights to guide strategic choices and improve overall team performance.

Furthermore, the project recognizes the growing interest in sports analytics for performance optimization and enhancing fan engagement and viewership experiences. By facilitating a more detailed analysis of game dynamics, player tracking systems contribute to more engaging and immersive viewing experiences, potentially transforming how fans engage with the sport.

In summary, this project is motivated by the intersection of technical challenges, the potential for significant contributions to sports analytics in ice hockey, and the broader implications for team performance and fan engagement. Through the investigation grounded in the latest research and technological innovations, it aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in sports analytics and player tracking.
